For over 20 years, repeated placement of microphones inside the womb has revealed that most sounds in a mother’s environment-- television, radio, CD players, normal conversation, maternal singing-- quite clearly reach the fetus (Life Before Birth, Whitwell). Research has shown that months before they are born, fetuses are extremely responsive to what’s happening in the “outside” world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Armed with ultrasound machines, researchers Peter Hepper and Sara Shahidullah found that fetuses first start reacting to some outside sounds as early as 14 weeks, with the ability to hear by 24 weeks (Brott and Ash 98). These sounds are of importance because they can establish the first patterns of communication and bonding (Life Before Birth, Whitwell).</p>

<p>Hearing noises is one thing, but are fetuses affected in any way by what they hear from within the womb? Absolutely. Peter Hepper (1991) discovered that prenates exposed to TV soap opera music during pregnancy responded with focused and rapt attention to this music after birth - evidence of long-term memory. On hearing the music after birth, these newborns stopped crying and had a significant decrease in heart rate and movements, and shifted into a more alert state (Life Before Birth, Whitwell).</p><br />

<h2>The Importance of Prenatal Sound and Music</h2>

<p>Column Editor: Giselle E. Whitwell, R.M.T.</p>

<p>The following excerpts are from the Importance of Prenatal Sound and Music.</p>

<p>Alfred Tomatis notes that the ear is "the Rome of the body" because almost all cranial nerves lead to it and therefore it is considered our most primary sense organ. Embryonically, according to him, the skin is differentiated ear, and we listen with our whole body.</p>

<p>The powerful connection between sound/music and prenatal memory/learning have been revealed in formal experiments, parental observations, clinical records, and first person reports. Chamberlain (1998) using Howard Gardner's concept of multiple intelligences, has presented evidence for musical intelligence before birth.</p>

<p>Tomatis has a unique view of the function of the human ear going beyond what is traditionally assumed. He regards it as neither an instrument solely for hearing and listening, nor an organ for the maintenance of equilibrium and verticality. For him the ear is primarily a generator of energy for the brain, intended to give a cortical charge, which is then distributed throughout the body "with the view to toning up the whole system and imparting greater dynamism to the human being" (Gilmor and Madaule, 1984, p. 6). Hence the importance of right sound stimulation which will lead to vocal expression, listening, and thinking. Sound, music and human development are intricately interwoven.</p>

<p>Uterine sounds form a "sound carpet" over which the mother's voice in particular appears very distinct and which the prenate gives special attention because it is so different from its own amniotic environment. These sounds are of major importance because they establish the first patterns of communication and bonding. Some researchers have discovered that newborns become calmer and more self-regulated when exposed to intrauterine sound (Murooka et. al 1976; DeCasper 1983; Rossner 1979). The soothing sounds of the ocean and water are probably reminiscent of the fluid environment in which we began life. Tomatis suggests that the maternal heartbeat, respiration and intestinal gurgling, all form the source for our collective attraction to the sound of surf and may have to do with our inborn sense of rhythm. Prenatal sounds form an important developmental component in prenatal life because they provide a foundation for later learning and behavior. With fetal sound stimulation the brain functions at a higher level of organization. For the entire article, please visit</p>

<h2>How to have a conversation with your baby</h2>

<p>Did you know that babies can be taught sign language? It’s amazing. For years we have thought that we had to wait until they could talk to really understand what they felt, wanted or needed. But that is no longer true. An amazing set of research by a man called Joseph Garcia has found that babies can indeed conceptualize and communicate – they just need to do it through signs rather than words! Joseph Garcia noticed when he was visiting a friend with a ten-month child who could not hear, that the child was communicating in a far more sophisticated way than the equivalent aged hearing child. The child was using American Sign Language. He began to research this and then completed a masters degree with this topic as his thesis.</p>

<p>What is more this ability to communicate through signing doesn’t slow down the acquisition of speech. As soon as a child can use this new form of communication they do. Their drive to communicate is so strong they will use whatever works best, fastest. Examples of children as young as seven or eight months who communicate their needs to their parents through sign language are increasing daily with more parents starting to use this method with their babies.</p>

<p>For instance a 10-month-old child was able to communicate to her mother that she was missing her father. He was working late at the office and had phoned home to speak to his wife. The little girl began to make the signs for ‘please daddy more’ when she heard whom her mother was speaking to.</p>

<p>It is an amazing sight to see such a young child communicating and interacting so easily rather than just being an attractive, appealing baby we can look at and coo over.</p>

<p>Pregnancy is a new and wonderful experience - an unpredictable, exquisite, demanding, and sometimes challenging journey. In the end, though, there is simply nothing like the joy of creating life and welcoming a new baby into the world.</p>

<p>We believe that all parents want to raise healthy and happy children, of course! As parents we want to strive to give our children as much love and as many opportunities as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, and as many of you already know, along with the joy of parenting also comes the challenge. This page will give you words of help and inspiration through those times of challenge. Below you will find stories about how to instill your child with self-esteem to how to have a conversation with your baby.</p>

<p>We hope the words on this page will help and inspire us all to be better parents. Enjoy!<br />

<h2>Poems About Life, Love and Children</h2>

<h3>Children Learn What They Live</h3>

<p>By Dorothy Law Nolte</p>

If a child lives with hostility, he learns to fight.<br />
If a child lives with fear, he learns to be apprehensive.<br />
If a child lives with pity, he learns to feel sorry for himself.<br />
If a child lives with ridicule, he learns to be shy.<br />
If a child lives with jealousy, he learns what envy is.<br />
If a child lives with shame, he learns to feel guilty.<br />
If a child lives with encouragement, he learns to be confident.<br />
If a child lives with tolerance, he learns to be patient.<br />
If a child lives with praise, he learns to be appreciative.<br />
If a child lives with acceptance, he learns to love.<br />
If a child lives with approval, he learns to like himself.<br />
If a child lives with recognition, he learns that it is good to have a goal.<br />
If a child lives with sharing, he learns about generosity.<br />
If a child lives with honesty and fairness, he learns what truth and justice are.<br />
If a child lives with security, he learns to have faith in himself and with those about him.<br />
If a child lives with friendliness, he learns that the world is a nice place in which to live.<br />
If you live with serenity, your child will live with peace of mind.<br />
What is your child living?<br />

<h3>If I Had my Child to Raise Over Again</h3>

<p>By Diane Loomans</p>

<p>If I had my child to raise all over again,<br />
I’d finger paint more, and point the finger less.<br />
I’d do less correcting, and more connecting.<br />
I’d take my eyes off my watch, and watch with my eyes.<br />
I would care to know less, and know to care more.<br />
I’d take more hikes and fly more kites.<br />
I’d stop playing serious, and seriously play.<br />
I’d run through more fields, and gaze at more stars.<br />
I’d do more hugging, and less tugging.<br />
I would be firm less often, and affirm much more.<br />
I’d build self esteem first, and the house later.<br />
I’d teach less about the love of power, and more about the power of love.<br />
<br /></p>

<h3>What all Children Want Their Parents to Know</h3>

<p>Teach me to love and care for myself through your positive example.<br />
I will learn much more from what you do than from anything you could say.</p>

<p>Notice me often, and take joy in my very existence, so that I grow up to feel special and know that I am loved.</p>

<p>Listen to me with an open ear and a loving heart, so that I learn to understand my feelings and trust that my needs will be heard.</p>

<p>Play with me often. Let down your guard and be more carefree. The memories will last long, and our connection ever longer.</p>

<p>Focus on what I’m doing right, and tell me when you appreciate me, so that I learn to feel worthy and motivated to do even more.</p>

<p>Tell me more about your life, your hopes, dreams, and successes, so that I come to know you as a person and can call you a friend as well as a parent.<br />
<br /></p>

<h3>All in the State of Mind</h3>

<p>If you thin you’re beaten, you are.<br />
If you think you dare not, you don’t<br />
If you’d like to win but think you can’t, it’s almost a cinch you won’t.<br />
If you think you’ll lose, you’ve lost.<br />
For out in the world you find success begins with a fellow’s will.<br />
It’s all in the state of mind.</p>

<p>For many a race is lost ere ever a step is run;<br />
And many a coward fails ere ever his work began.<br />
Think big and your deeds will grow, think small and you’ll fall behind.<br />
Think that you can and you will.<br />
It’s all in the state of mind.</p>

<p>If you think you’re outclassed, you are;<br />
You’ve got to think high to rise.<br />
You’ve got to be sure of yourself before you can ever win a prize.<br />
Life’s battles don’t always go to the stronger or faster man,<br />
But sooner or later the man who wins is the fellow who thinks he can.<br />
It’s all in the state of mind.<br />
